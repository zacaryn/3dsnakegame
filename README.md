# 🐍 3D Snake Game

To celebrate the Year of the Snake, I built a **3D Snake Game** where two AI-controlled snakes battle it out in an OpenGL-rendered arena! No human players—just two competing AIs making strategic moves to outmaneuver each other. *(What language better to make this in but Python?)*  

## 🚀 Key Features  
- 🧠 **AI-Driven Gameplay** – Adaptive pathfinding ensures smart movement decisions  
- 🎮 **3D Collision Detection** – Snakes avoid walls, themselves, and each other  
- 🍏 **Multi-Food System** – Regular & bonus food with boosts for more dynamic battles  
- 📷 **Camera Control** – Rotate and adjust the view for full visibility  


## 🔧 Installation & Running  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zacaryn/3dsnakegame.git
   cd 3dsnakegame

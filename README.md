o celebrate the Year of the Snake, I built a 3D Snake Game where two AI-controlled snakes battle it out, in an OpenGL-rendered arena! No human playersâ€”just the two competing AIs making strategic moves to outmaneuver each other. (What language better to make this in but Python)

ðŸš€ Key Features:
ðŸ”¹ AI-driven movement with adaptive pathfinding
ðŸ”¹ 3D collision
ðŸ”¹ Multi-food system: Regular & bonus food (Boosts are very fun to watch)
ðŸ”¹ Camera rotation for full perspective control

Each AI evaluates optimal paths to food, avoids self-collisions, and even reacts to the opponentâ€™s movements, creating an intense battle of algorithms. Implementing this required fine-tuning AI behavior, leveraging NumPy for movement calculations, and optimizing OpenGL rendering for smooth visuals.
